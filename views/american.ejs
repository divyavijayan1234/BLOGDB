                    American Shorthairs are a diverse breed with an array of colors and patterns. Silver tabby is one of the
                    most common and popular.

                    Your American Shorthair will shed but combing a couple of times per week removes dead hair and
                    redistributes skin oils to keep her coat shiny and prevent dry, itchy skin.

                    The American Shorthair is a hearty and healthy breed. Some instances of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have
                    been recorded, but itâ€™s unknown if the condition is hereditary. Their flat face also makes the breed
                    more susceptible to ocular and respiratory issues. They are genetically predisposed to mouth and gum
                    disease, and their laid-back nature increases their risk of obesity. Reputable breeders test thoroughly
                    to avoid breeding cats with genetic diseases.
