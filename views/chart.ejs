            Sturdy, robust cat, not leaning towards fat or hefty. The overall impression is of a 'business' cat, rather than
            a 'lazy' cat.

                Low-chaos, thoughtful cat, not too loud, demanding, or dramatic. Bonds well with family, though typically
                bonding most strongly with just one person. Affectionate with everyone they live with, easy to handle, and
                good travelers, which is not a usual feline trait. They appreciate short playtimes interspersed with naps
                and meals. They rarely use their voice, preferring to use their eyes to communicate. If necessary, they can
                be vocal to get attention.

                First mentioned in the early 1700s when they were kept as ratters but were also killed for their meat and
                pelts during famines, economic crises, and wars in France. Surviving Chartreux had to be quick-witted and
                hardy, traits that remain in the modern Chartreux to some extent. In the early 20th Century, cat breeders
                realized very few wild colonies of Chartreux remained, leading to efforts to preserve the breed. The breed
                description was based on 18th-century descriptions and has changed little since, which is rare in the cat
                world.

            Country of Origin: Abyssinia (Ethiopia) Other Names: Abys, Bunny cat The Abyssinian cat resembles the African
            wildcat, ancestor of the domestic cat. The history of the Abyssinian cat in the UK is a little obscure, but it
            is likely that it was brought back via army personnel from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia), in the 1860s. The early
            Abyssinian cats were crossed with British Shorthairs, and later with oriental breeds. Long-haired Abyssinian
            kittens have been found in litters for many years, and since the 1970s they have been developed as a separate
            breed called the Somali.
